MacroDebugger is a lightweight C++ debugging utility designed for embedded systems and custom HID (Human Interface Device) development. This project provides a set of preprocessor macros and tools that simplify logging, tracing, and debugging in resource-constrained environments.

Macro-Based Debugging: Easily insert debug output with minimal overhead using custom macros.

HID Integration: Built with the NicoHood/HID library to support advanced USB HID functionality on Arduino-compatible boards.

PlatformIO Support: Ready-to-use configuration for PlatformIO, enabling quick setup and deployment.

Custom Keypad Macros: Ideal for projects that use macro pads or debugging keypads to automate and streamline development tasks.

Modular Codebase: Cleanly separated headers, sources, and tests for easy navigation and maintenance.
